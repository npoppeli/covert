atom.py
-------
define_atom('gender', ...) in application, not in framework
genders = ['?', 'v', 'm'] must be I18N
define_atom('boolean', ...) also I18N
MINYEAR = 1400 (not midnight) to avoid complaints from RethinkDB

config.py
---------
* I18N the right way

layout.py
---------
* move Tonnikala out of the core

model.py
--------
* embedding in show panels
* embedding and linking in form panels
* tools for adding, modifying and deleting list-valued items (multiple=True)
* tools for adding, modifying and deleting linked items (references)
* tools for adding, modifying and deleting embedded items
* item revisions (add 'rev' attribute)
* make labels in BareItem language-dependent (I18N)
* 'active' attribute in BareItem is not 'auto', but has a default (True)
* query translation must include mapping of values as well (wmap)

Notes on item revisions
1. If the number of revisions is low, keep all of them in the storage, and mark the
   most recent one of them as the active revision.
2. Otherwise, keep only the active revision in the item storage, and store
   backward deltas in a separate storage (use libdiff for text).

List items in forms: add grid buttons 'insert before' and 'insert after'
(FontAwesome: angle-double-up and angle-double-down). JavaScript with local action.

Item references in forms: t0 and t2 readonly=true, t1 hidden.
JavaScript with server interaction.

view.py
-------
* I18N of setting.labels and messages
* authorization determines icon and button states (enabled, disabled)
* delete button is enabled iff item.active
* add 'import' method (form-based file upload, CSV and JSON)
* allow fields of 'multiple' type in search form
* make ItemView.sort independent from db engine
* pass ItemView.sort to render tree methods in a more elegant way
* itemlist with clickable column headers to influence sorting
* Use Mirage (JS) for client-side generation of search queries
* Use Alpaca (JS) for client-side form handling
* routes should set 'title' attribute of render tree, templates should display it
* add boolean vector 'active', 'modified' recently) to the render tree (add_item, add_items)
* boolean vector 'modified' could be part of event handler
