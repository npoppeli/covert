atom.py
-------
genders = ['?', 'v', 'm'] must be I18N
define_atom('boolean', ...) also I18N
MINYEAR = 1400 (not midnight) to avoid complaints from RethinkDB

config.py
---------
* I18N the right way

layout.py
---------
* migrate to Bootstrap 4 (now 3.3.7)
* migrate to jQuery 3 (now 1.10.2)

model.py
--------
* embedding in show panels
* embedding in form panels
* tools for adding, modifying and deleting linked items (references)
* tools for adding, modifying and deleting embedded items
* item revisions (add 'key' and 'rev' attributes)
* make labels in BareItem language-dependent (I18N)
* 'active' attribute in BareItem is not 'auto', but has a default (True)
* images: keep thumbnail in db as binary date field
  show with
  <img alt="..." src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAADIA..." />
  and keep images > 1 MB in filesystem (content-addressable storage).
  See "To BLOB or Not To BLOB", Microsoft Research Technical Report 2006-45

Notes on item revisions
1. If the number of revisions is low, keep all of them in the storage, and mark the
   most recent one of them as the active revision.
2. Otherwise, keep only the active revision in the item storage, and store
   backward deltas in a separate storage (use libdiff for text).

Item references in forms: t0 and t2 readonly=true, t1 hidden.
JavaScript with server interaction.

view.py
-------
* I18N of setting.labels and messages
* authorization determines icon and button states (enabled, disabled)
* delete button is enabled if authorized and item is active
* collection_buttons_extra: where to set them?
* add 'import' method (form-based file upload, CSV and JSON)
* make Itemview.prune configurable (Itemview.clip(), 2 modes)
* itemlist with clickable column headers to influence sorting
* Use JavaScript for client-side generation of search queries
* Use Alpaca (JS) for client-side form handling
* move boolean vector 'active' and 'modified' to event handler
* image upload with:
if form[field].file:
  path = os.path.join(upload_dir, form[field].filename)
  copy fileitem.file to file 'path' with shutil.copyfileobj
else:
  # something else

engine/mongodb.py
-----------------
* make database connection thread-safe
* datetime objects *with* timezone
* text index via Collection.ensureIndex({'author': 'text', 'content': 'text'})

engine/rethinkdb.py
-------------------
* datetime objects *with* timezone
* text index via ...
* query translation must include mapping of values as well (wmap)
